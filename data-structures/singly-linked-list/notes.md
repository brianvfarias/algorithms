# Singly Linked List

## What is a linked list?

A data structure that contains a head, tail and length
property.

The main difference from a Linked List (LL) to an Array is the fact that the Linked List does not have indexes, that is, each item has a **pointer** or **vertex** to the next one (the last item points to null).

Each item in the LL is called a node. The "key" nodes are the first "head" and the last "tail".

### Comparison with Arrays

Lists
• Do not have indexes!
• Connected via nodes with a next pointer
• Random access is not allowed (no indexes)
Arrays
• Indexed in order!
• Insertion and deletion can be expensive
• Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
